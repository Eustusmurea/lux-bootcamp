## Overview

RFM Analysis is a fundamental concept utilized extensively by data science professionals, particularly within the realm of marketing. Its primary purpose is to comprehend and categorize customers based on their purchasing behaviors.

Through RFM Analysis, a business can gauge various aspects of their customers, including:

Recency: This metric reflects the time elapsed since the customer's last purchase.
Frequency: It measures how often a customer makes purchases.
Monetary Value: This aspect quantifies the total amount spent by the customer on purchases.
These three core metrics—Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value—offer invaluable insights into customer engagement, loyalty, and overall value to a business.

To undertake RFM analysis with Python, a dataset containing customer IDs, purchase dates, and transaction amounts is essential. Armed with this data, we can compute RFM scores for each customer, allowing for an in-depth exploration of their purchasing patterns and behaviors.


## Data
The data used was dowloaded online from https://statso.io/rfm-analysis-case-study/ 

## Preprocessing

I started by importing the packages i woild be using
 ``` 
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.io as pio
import plotly.graph_objects as go
pio.templates.default = "plotly_white"

I loaded the data using this code 
 
data = pd.read_csv("rfm_data.csv")

To calculate recency, I subtracted the purchase date from the current date and extracted the number of days using the `datetime.now().date()` function. This method provided me with the number of days since the customer's last purchase, effectively representing their recency value.

Next, I focused on calculating the frequency for each customer. I grouped the data by 'CustomerID' and counted the number of unique 'OrderID' values to determine how many purchases each customer had made. This approach yielded the frequency value, which in turn represented the total number of purchases for each customer.

Lastly, I tackled the calculation of monetary value for each customer. I again grouped the data by 'CustomerID' but this time summed the 'TransactionAmount' values to obtain the total amount spent by each customer. This process yielded the monetary value, signifying the total financial contribution made by each customer.

``` python
from datetime import datetime

# Convert 'PurchaseDate' to datetime
data['PurchaseDate'] = pd.to_datetime(data['PurchaseDate'])

# Calculate Recency
data['Recency'] = (datetime.now().date() - data['PurchaseDate'].dt.date).dt.days

# Calculate Frequency
frequency_data = data.groupby('CustomerID')['OrderID'].count().reset_index()
frequency_data.rename(columns={'OrderID': 'Frequency'}, inplace=True)
data = data.merge(frequency_data, on='CustomerID', how='left')

# Calculate Monetary Value
monetary_data = data.groupby('CustomerID')['TransactionAmount'].sum().reset_index()
monetary_data.rename(columns={'TransactionAmount': 'MonetaryValue'}, inplace=True)
data = data.merge(monetary_data, on='CustomerID', how='left')

I used a scoring system ranging from 5 to 1 to determine the recency score, where a higher score reflects a more recent purchase. Essentially, this means that customers who have made purchases more recently receive higher recency scores.

Similarly, I employed a scoring system from 1 to 5 to calculate the frequency score, with a higher score indicating a higher purchase frequency. Customers who made more frequent purchases were assigned higher frequency scores.

For the monetary score, I applied a scoring system ranging from 1 to 5, where a higher score signifies a greater amount spent by the customer.

To compute the RFM scores, I utilized the `pd.cut()` function, dividing the recency, frequency, and monetary values into five bins each. Subsequently, I assigned corresponding scores to each of these bins.

``` python
# Define scoring criteria for each RFM value
recency_scores = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]  # Higher score for more recent
frequency_scores = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Higher score for higher frequency
monetary_scores = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Higher score for higher monetary value

# Calculate RFM scores
data['RecencyScore'] = pd.cut(data['Recency'], bins=5, labels=recency_scores)
data['FrequencyScore'] = pd.cut(data['Frequency'], bins=5, labels=frequency_scores)
data['MonetaryScore'] = pd.cut(data['MonetaryValue'], bins=5, labels=monetary_scores)

To compute the RFM score, I summed the scores derived from recency, frequency, and monetary value. For instance, if a customer received a recency score of 3, a frequency score of 4, and a monetary score of 5, their resulting RFM score would be 12.

Following the calculation of RFM scores, I proceeded to create RFM segments based on these scores. The segmentation process involved dividing RFM scores into three distinct segments, namely "Low-Value," "Mid-Value," and "High-Value." To accomplish this, I utilized the `pd.qcut()` function, which ensures an even distribution of scores among these segments.

``` python
# Convert RFM scores to numeric type
data['RecencyScore'] = data['RecencyScore'].astype(int)
data['FrequencyScore'] = data['FrequencyScore'].astype(int)
data['MonetaryScore'] = data['MonetaryScore'].astype(int)

# Calculate RFM score by combining the individual scores
data['RFM_Score'] = data['RecencyScore'] + data['FrequencyScore'] + data['MonetaryScore']

# Create RFM segments based on the RFM score
segment_labels = ['Low-Value', 'Mid-Value', 'High-Value']
data['Value Segment'] = pd.qcut(data['RFM_Score'], q=3, labels=segment_labels)

# RFM Segment Distribution
segment_counts = data['Value Segment'].value_counts().reset_index()
segment_counts.columns = ['Value Segment', 'Count']

pastel_colors = px.colors.qualitative.Pastel

# Create the bar chart
fig_segment_dist = px.bar(segment_counts, x='Value Segment', y='Count', 
                          color='Value Segment', color_discrete_sequence=pastel_colors,
                          title='RFM Value Segment Distribution')

# Update the layout
fig_segment_dist.update_layout(xaxis_title='RFM Value Segment',
                              yaxis_title='Count',
                              showlegend=False)

# Show the figure
fig_segment_dist.show()
 

let us analyze the correlation of the recency, frequency, and monetary scores within the champions segment
```python
# Calculate the average Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores for each segment
segment_scores = data.groupby('RFM Customer Segments')['RecencyScore', 'FrequencyScore', 'MonetaryScore'].mean().reset_index()

# Create a grouped bar chart to compare segment scores
fig = go.Figure()

# Add bars for Recency score
fig.add_trace(go.Bar(
    x=segment_scores['RFM Customer Segments'],
    y=segment_scores['RecencyScore'],
    name='Recency Score',
    marker_color='rgb(158,202,225)'
))

# Add bars for Frequency score
fig.add_trace(go.Bar(
    x=segment_scores['RFM Customer Segments'],
    y=segment_scores['FrequencyScore'],
    name='Frequency Score',
    marker_color='rgb(186,170,64)'
))

# Add bars for Monetary score
fig.add_trace(go.Bar(
    x=segment_scores['RFM Customer Segments'],
    y=segment_scores['MonetaryScore'],
    name='Monetary Score',
    marker_color='rgb(32,102,148)'
))

# Update the layout
fig.update_layout(
    title='Comparison of RFM Segments based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Scores',
    xaxis_title='RFM Segments',
    yaxis_title='Score',
    barmode='group',
    showlegend=True
)

fig.show()

In conclusion, RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a valuable technique in data science, particularly within the realm of marketing and customer segmentation. This approach enables businesses to gain a deep understanding of their customer base, categorizing customers into meaningful segments based on their recent purchasing behavior, frequency of purchases, and the monetary value they contribute.

Throughout the RFM analysis project, we have:

Computed RFM Scores: We calculated individual RFM scores for each customer by assigning scores based on recency, frequency, and monetary value, reflecting their engagement and value to the business.
